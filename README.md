# Kali-Linux-Tools
Bash Scripts - Designed for quick software downloading in Kali Linux OS

Some bash scripts I wrote for setting up various tools within the Kali Linux environment. 
In order to properly use these tools you must first create a folder on your desktop called 'Kali-Linux-Tools'. 
Then make sure you have the proper permissions to run the 'Set-Permissions.sh' script. 
** to make sure you have the proper permissions to run 'Set-Permissions.sh' open a terminal and type the following:

cd /Desktop
sudo -s (enter your password)
chown root /Kali-Linux-Tools/Set-Permissions.sh
chmod 777 /Kali-Linux-Tools/Set-Permissions.sh

Now you can open a terminal window, drag and drop the 'Set-Permissions.sh' script in it and hit enter. It will set the proper
permissions for ALL of the other scripts I wrote.

You can then open a terminal and drop all the shell scripts into the terminal window and run them!
